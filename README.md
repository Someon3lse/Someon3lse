Welcome to my user!!
I am Someon3lse, programming fan, and a inveterate reader.

A bit of everything!!
(Yes. But I'm going to work only on one project at the same time)
Now, I'm working on Some Stupid Captcha's Game (2SCG), a game designed to know if you are a robot or an AI with millimeter precision.
Are you a robot?
  
# For developers... In what coding languages you are going to make your apps?
